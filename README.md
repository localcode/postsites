## PostSites

---

PostSites is a set of python modules for managing PostGIS data sets and retrieving multiple layers of spatial data for a set of sites, represented by the features on a particular layer. It allows one to retrieve multple layers of data based on proximity to a point, and for organizing layers into specific types (such as terrain, parcels, etc.) for import into other programs.


PostSites is being developed as part of the [Local Code](http://vimeo.com/8080630) project under the leadership of [Nicholas de Monchaux](www.nicholas.demonchuax.com), Assistant Professor of Architecture and Urban Design at the [UC Berkeley College of Environmental Design](http://ced.berkeley.edu/).
