## Installation and Setting Up

Using PostSites depends on having a number of tools installed. We are continually trying to reduce the amount of effort necessary to set up PostSites and start working with GIS data, but it takes time to wrap up and automate things which can be technically complex, and to create substitutes for tools that are designed primarily for scientists and engineers. If you have any suggestions on ways to make this process easier, we are interested in hearing them.

Here is an rough overview of the steps:

1. Install PostgreSQL
1. Install PostGIS
1. Install GIS code libraries
1. Set up Python

And once you're finished with the above, here's how you get started with PostSites:

1. Find data. 
1. Load it into the database. 
2. Set up your sites. 

After that, you're ready to do whatever you like with your sites. Here's some ideas on other things you can do:

1. Analyze and classify your sites
1. Import your sites into a 3d modeling program
1. Make your sites load faster
2. Put your sites on the Internet
2. Generate infographics about your sites.
3. Edit information about your sites.
