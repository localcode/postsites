## Finding Data

This example is supposed to guide you through the process of finding and downloading GIS data. Finding GIS data can be a confusing and tricky process, involving asking permission, contacting people, navigation poor download interface on the internet, searching dark corners of the web, and converting data from obscure formats into more usable formats. GIS data is not available for all locations, and some people are more protective of their data than others. If you find it difficult to obtain data for an area where you would like to work, don't be discouraged. Think about how much work it takes to create the data in the first place, and be grateful for whatever you _can_ find.

I try to bookmark any website that I find which might lead me to useful or interesting data, and you should too. Please feel free to add anything to this list. You can view my bookmarks at [http://delicious.com/benjamin_golder/gis/data](http://delicious.com/benjamin_golder/gis/data).
